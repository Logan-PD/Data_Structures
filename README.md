# Basic-Data-Structures

asn2 is a implementation of a treap. Heavy commenting with precondition and postcondition for every method
and loop invariants. "Treap.java" is the file written by me.

asn3 is an implementation of merge-insertion sort, also with heavy commenting.

Both include tests.
